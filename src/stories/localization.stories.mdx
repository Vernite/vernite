# Localization
App is localized using [angular/localize](https://angular.io/api/localize). At the current stage of the project app is translated in:

```lua
de-DE -> German (Germany)
en-GB -> English (United Kingdom)
en-US -> English (United States, Default app language)
es-ES -> Spanish (Spain)
it-IT -> Italian (Italy)
pl-PL -> Polish (Poland)
uk-UA -> Ukrainian (Ukraine)
```

## Configuration

Each language is listed in `angular.json` file in `i18n` section.
For `polish` language for example:

```json
"i18n": {
  ...
  "locales": {
    "pl-PL": {
      "translation": "src/locales/messages.pl-PL.xlf"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

Languages also requires separated file in `src/locales` folder to be created before build.

It is also required to add language locale codes in `.ngI18nconfig`. This config is used by Visual Studio Code extension to make translating this app easier.
The config looks like:

```json
{
  "locales": ["pl-PL", "en-GB", "it-IT", "es-ES", "de-DE", "uk-UA"],
  "editor": {
    "messageLocations": ["src/locales/messages.xlf"],
    "translationFileNamePattern": "${name}.${lang}-${region}",
    "taskConfig": {
      "intervalSeconds": 5,
      "itemEachPack": 10
    }
  }
}
```

```
// TODO: Write something about redirect.html file
```

In the future adding new language will need some more work to do. For example adding new element in language selection list.


## Making translations

Before translating strings first what you need to do is to extract all translatable strings from the app. To do this run the command:
```bash
yarn extract:i18n
```

Each language translations are located in `src/locales` folder, for example `src/locales/messages.pl-PL.xlf` file. This files can be edited using any text editor, but more convenient is to use external tools.

In Visual Studio Code there is an extension named `Angular I18n Editor`. This extension is used to make translations in more human readable way. It serves an UI interface to edit translations. To open this extension press `F1` and search for `Angular I18n Editor: Open` command.
