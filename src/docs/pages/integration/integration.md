# CI/CD pipeline
Continuos integration was resolved using tool named [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Actions are located in `.github/workflows/` directory. At this moment there is one pipeline to deploy application named `deploy.yml`. This action after every push to the master branch rebuild the application and deploy it to the production environment using `rsync protocol`. This action also build documentation page, publishes it and runs tests. There is also included a small script to create badges to use them in `Readme.md` and documentation files. This file is named `badge-generator.js` and is located in the root directory.
